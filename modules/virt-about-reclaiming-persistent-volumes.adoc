= About reclaiming persistent volumes

When you reclaim a persistent volume (PV), you unbind the PV from a persistent volume claim (PVC)
and delete the data in the network share. Finally, you bind the PV to a new PVC to
prepare the volume for reuse.

[IMPORTANT]
The `Recycle` reclaim policy is deprecated in {product-title} 4. Dynamic provisioning is recommended for equivalent and better functionality.
