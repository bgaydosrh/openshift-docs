= Reclaiming persistent volumes for binding to a new persistent volume

Use this procedure to reclaim a statically-provisioned persistent volume for reuse.

.Procedure
. Export the PV configuration for future use and edit YAML file, if needed:
+
----
$ oc get pv <pv_name> -o yaml > <file_name>.yaml
----
+
. Enter the following command to display connection details for the persistent volume
you want to reclaim. Save the output for future reference.
+
----
$ oc describe pv <pv_name>
----
. Review the `StorageClass` object. Verify that the Storage Class `reclaimPolicy` is set to `delete`.
If it is not, create a new `StorageClass` object with `reclaimPolicy` set to `delete`.

. Enter the following command to verify that no other resources
are using the persistent volume claim:
+
----
$ oc describe pvc <pvc_name>
----
. Delete the persistent volume claim to release the persistent volume:
+
----
$ oc delete pvc/<volume_claim>
----
. Delete the persistent volume:
+
----
$ oc delete pv/<volume>
----
. Delete all data in the network share:
+
----
$ rm -rf <path_to_share>
----
. Create a persistent volume by editing the PV's YAML to
create a new object. When you create the volume, use the same connection details
as the deleted persistent volume.
.. Enter the following command to export the PV's configuration for editing:
+
----
$ oc get pv <pv_name> -o yaml > pv.yaml
----
.. Edit the `pv.yaml` file.
.. Change the `name` of the PV in the YAML file to the name of the new PV.
.. See the Additional Resources section in this topic to finish creating the PV.
