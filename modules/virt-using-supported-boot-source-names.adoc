= Using supported boot source names

When you upload boot sources and associate them with an operating system image, it is important that the volume name match the name of the system-defined template. If you do not name the volume in this manner, you will be unable to upload the image and use it to create virtual machines.

// What should the user do if their OS is not listed in the following table? // Should we say only the following OSs are supported?

Use the following table to determine the name of the volume that you define as a boot source.
