== About {CNVProductName} {CNVVersion}

include::modules/cnv-what-you-can-do-with-cnv.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

=== {CNVProductNameStart} support

:FeatureName: {CNVProductName}
include::modules/technology-preview.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

== New and changed features

* View high-level information about your virtual machines by
using the *Virtual Machines* dashboard in the {product-name} web console.
Access it by navigating to the *Workloads* -> *Virtual Machines* page and
selecting a virtual machine.

== Resolved issues

* When adding a disk to a virtual machine via the *Disks* tab in the web console,
the added disk always has a `Filesystem` volumeMode, regardless of the volumeMode
set in the `kubevirt-storage-class-default` ConfigMap.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1753688[*BZ#1753688*])

* When navigating to the *Virtual Machines Console* tab, sometimes no content
is displayed. As a workaround, use the serial console.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1753606[*BZ#1753606*])

* When you attempt to list all instances of the {CNVProductName} operator from a
browser, you receive a 404 (page not found) error.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1757526[*BZ#1757526*])

* If a virtual machine uses guaranteed CPUs, it will not be scheduled, because
the label `cpumanager=true` is not automatically set on nodes. As a
workaround, remove the `CPUManager` entry from the `kubevirt-config` ConfigMap.
Then, manually label the nodes with `cpumanager=true` before running virtual
machines with guaranteed CPUs on your cluster.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1718944[*BZ#1718944*])

== Known issues

* If you have {CNVProductName} 2.1.0 deployed, you must first upgrade to 2.2.0
before upgrading {product-title}.

// Don't remove: this BZ is probably true for all 2.x releases
* The `masquerade` binding method for virtual machines cannot be used in clusters with RHEL 7 compute nodes.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1741626[*BZ#1741626*])

* After migration, a virtual machine is assigned a new IP address. However, the
commands `oc get vmi` and `oc describe vmi` still generate output containing the
obsolete IP address. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1686208[*BZ#1686208*])
+
** As a workaround, view the correct IP address by running the following command:
+
----
$ oc get pod -o wide
----

* Some resources are improperly retained when removing {CNVProductName}. You
must manually remove these resources in order to reinstall {CNVProductName}.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1712429[*BZ#1712429*])

* Users without administrator privileges cannot add a network interface
to a project in an L2 network using the virtual machine wizard.
This issue is caused by missing permissions that allow users to load
network attachment definitions.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1743985[*BZ#1743985*])
+
** As a workaround, provide the user with permissions to load the network attachment
definitions.
+
. Define `ClusterRole` and `ClusterRoleBinding` objects to the YAML configuration
file, using the following examples:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
 name: cni-resources
rules:
- apiGroups: ["k8s.cni.cncf.io"]
 resources: ["*"]
 verbs: ["*"]
----
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: <role-binding-name>
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: cni-resources
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: <user to grant the role to>
  namespace: <namespace of the user>
----
+
. As a `cluster-admin` user, run the following command to create the `ClusterRole`
and `ClusterRoleBinding` objects you defined:
+
----
$ oc create -f <filename>.yaml
----

* Live migration fails when nodes have different CPU models. Even in cases where
nodes have the same physical CPU model, differences introduced by microcode
updates have the same effect. This is because the default settings trigger
host CPU passthrough behavior, which is incompatible with live migration.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1760028[*BZ#1760028*])
+
** As a workaround, set the default CPU model in the `kubevirt-config` ConfigMap,
as shown in the following example:
+
[NOTE]
====
You must make this change before starting the virtual machines that support
live migration.
====
+
. Open the `kubevirt-config` ConfigMap for editing by running the following command:
+
----
$ oc edit configmap kubevirt-config -n openshift-cnv
----
+
. Edit the ConfigMap:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: kubevirt-config
data:
  default-cpu-model: "<cpu-model>" <1>
----
<1> Replace `<cpu-model>` with the actual CPU model value. You can determine this
value by running `oc describe node <node>` for all nodes and looking at the
`cpu-model-<name>` labels. Select the CPU model that is present on all of your
nodes.

* The {CNVProductName} upgrade process occasionally fails due to an interruption
from the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM). This issue is caused by the limitations
associated with using a declarative API to track the state of {CNVProductName}
Operators. Enabling automatic updates during
xref:../cnv-install/installing-container-native-virtualization.adoc#cnv-subscribing-to-hco-catalog_installing-container-native-virtualization[installation]
decreases the risk of encountering this issue.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1759612[*BZ#1759612*])

* {CNVProductNameStart} cannot reliably identify node drains that are triggered by
running either `oc adm drain` or `kubectl drain`. Do not run these commands on
the nodes of any clusters where {CNVProductName} is deployed. The nodes might not
drain if there are virtual machines running on top of them.
The current solution is to put nodes into maintenance.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1795182[*BZ#1795182*])
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1795186[*BZ#1795186*])

* When running `virtctl image-upload` to upload large VM disk images in `qcow2`
format, an end-of-file (EOF) error may be reported after the data is
transmitted, even though the upload is either progressing normally or completed.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1789093[*BZ#1789093*])
+
Run the following command to check the status of an upload on a given PVC:
+
----
$ oc describe pvc <pvc-name> | grep cdi.kubevirt.io/storage.pod.phase
----

* When attempting to create and launch a virtual machine using a Haswell CPU,
the launch of the virtual machine can fail. This is a bug due to incorrectly
labeled nodes and a change in behavior from previous versions of
container-native virtualization, where virtual machines could be successfully
launched on Haswell hosts.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1781497[*BZ#1781497*])
+
As a workaround, select a different CPU model, if possible.

* If you select a directory that shares space with your Operating System,
you can potentially exhaust the space on the partition, causing the node to
be non-functional. Instead, create a separate partition
and point the hostpath provisioner to that partition so it will not
interfere with your Operating System.
