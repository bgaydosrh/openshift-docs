A _boot source_ is a bootable disk containing an operating system (OS) and all of the configuration settings for the OS, such as drivers. You use a boot source to create bootable virtual machines with specific configurations.

To use boot sources, you must install the latest version of {VirtProductName}. You then create a persistent volume claim (PVC) by using the {product-title} web console to upload a boot source to the PVC. After uploading, you create virtual machines or virtual machine templates from the uploaded images by using the wizard in the web console.
